# Uncommon VHDL Integer Range Issue and Potential Overflow

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VHDL code related to integer range handling. The code implements a simple counter, but the use of an integer type with a specific range can lead to unexpected behavior or simulation errors.  The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file contains the buggy code, and `buggy_counter_solution.vhdl` provides a corrected version.

**Bug Description:**
The original code uses an `integer` type with a specified range (0 to 15). While functionally correct in this simple example, this approach can become problematic with more complex scenarios, and integer overflow can be difficult to debug.  The solution shows a more robust implementation.

**Solution:**
The solution uses an unsigned type instead of an integer, improving clarity and preventing overflow issues. Using unsigned types is more common and often safer for counters in VHDL.
